 Vagrant+SaltStack environment for lnls-fac software development


Dependencies
------------

 This repository contains files for setting up an environment for development
 of lnls-fac software. To use it, you need to have Vagrant
 (https://www.vagrantup.com/) and VirtualBox (https://www.virtualbox.org/)
 installed. In case you do not have them installed, download and follow the
 instructions from the links.


Configuration
-------------

 Before running Vagrant, run replace_ip.py passing as an argument the component
 of the IP address to be substituted in 192.168.<ip_component>.20. When using a
 shared computer, ensure that the component is not already being used by other
 virtual machines. If the computer is not shared, use any valid number, such as
 50:

     ./replace_ip.py <ip_component>


Choosing the lnls-fac package versions
--------------------------------------

 The versions of the lnls-fac packages to be used are set in the file
 vm/pillar/versions.sls. To use different versions, simply change the values to
 other valid repository release tags.


Usage
-----

 To set up the environment, download or clone this repository with

     git clone https://github.com/lnls-fac/dev-vagrant.git

 Then cd into the directory with

     cd dev-vagrant

 and issue

     vagrant up

 On the first run, it may take long for the virtual machine to be set up.
 After the machine has been started, ssh into dev with

     vagrant ssh

 and apply the state by issuing

     sudo salt '*' state.apply

 It may also take long the first time the state is applied, as many packages
 need to be downloaded and installed. The virtual machine needs rebooting after
 the first state application.

 To ssh as user fac, use (the default fac user password is 'fac123'; remember
 to change it on first login):

     vagrant ssh -- -l fac -X

 To change the repository versions, set values in dev/salt/pillar/versions.sls
 and apply the states with

     sudo salt '*' state.apply repos.dev
